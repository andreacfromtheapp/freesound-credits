# freesound_credits

A command line utility to credit [Freesound](https://freesound.org) samples for
a given project.

## Notes

- It only works with samples adhering to Freesound naming standard.
- It is a quick "rust for fun" just to satisfy a personal need.

## Usage

## DAW sample folders

### Ableton

When running against Ableton projects, pass the `--path` to the
`Samples/Imported` directory.

### Renoise

Renoise `xrns` projects need to be extracted with `unzip` first. Once unzipped
you will find a `Song.xml` file and a `SamplesData` directory containing each
`Instrument`. Pass the `--path` to the `SamplesData` directory.

### Reaper

When running against Reaper projects, pass the `--path` to the
`Audio Files` directory.

### Logic Pro X

Depending on how you saved your project ([Package vs
Folder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33zVydB4MiI))
, pass the `--path` to the `Audio Files` directory.
