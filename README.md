## Giving credits

Giving credits in the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org) community
is often the sole requirement to freely use samples in your own creations. This
tool helps you abide to [Copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft)
and credit the generous artists that contribute sounds on
[Freesound](https://freesound.org), helping you being more creative.

Until today, giving credits may have been a process that you begrudged. This
may have been stopping you from giving credits altogether. Not because you
didn't want to, but because it was cumbersome and tedious.

Not anymore! Thanks to `freesound-credits` utility it takes seconds now!

## Install

Use [`cargo binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) to install
freesound-credits binary directly from GitHub:

```
cargo binstall freesound-credits
```

## Usage

The command line comes with a straight-forward usage function:

```text
Simple program to generate Freesound credits in a usable markdown file

Usage: freesound-credits [OPTIONS] --path <PATH> --title <TITLE> --date <DATE> --artist <ARTIST>

Options:
  -p, --path <PATH>      Path to the samples directory
  -t, --title <TITLE>    Song title (quote multiple words)
  -d, --date <DATE>      Song release date (quote multiple words)
  -a, --artist <ARTIST>  Song artist (quote multiple words)
  -z, --zola             Include Zola frontmatter atop the markdown file
  -h, --help             Print help
  -V, --version          Print version
```

### Usage example

1. open your favorite terminal.
2. `cd` to the folder where you want to save the credits file.
3. run `freesound-credits` on your desired samples folder.
4. if necessary, use the absolute path to the samples folder.

#### Ableton Example

Running against an Ableton `Samples/Imported` directory, will generate a
markdown file named `field-notes-credits.md` in the current directory.

```bash
freesound-credits -p Samples/Imported/ -t "Field Notes" -a "Aner Andros" -d "2017-10-28"
```

## Supported filenames

`freesound-credits` matches samples adhering to Freesound naming standard that
kept their original samples names per downloads from the platform. For example:

- new standard with double underscore: `69604__timkahn__subverse_whisper.wav`
- old standard with single underscore: `2166_suburban_grilla_bowl_struck.flac`

## Supported DAWs

`freesound-credits` should work for any samples stored in a flat folder.
`freesound-credits` filters out metadata files associated with audio imports.
To add more DAWs and associated metadata or extraction, please file an issue.

| DAW | Samples Folder | Metadata | Extraction | Notes |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Ableton | `Samples/Imported` | `.asd` | no | |
| Renoise | `SamplesData` | no | `unzip` | [extraction](#renoise-extraction) |
| Repaer  | `Audio Files` | `.reapeaks` | no | |
| Logic Pro X  | `Audio Files` | no | no | [Package vs Folder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33zVydB4MiI) |

### Adding more DAWs

I did the best I could with what I have. I've tested it with Ableton, Reaper,
and Renoise projects on macOS. Logic Pro X uses no metadata and a clean Audio
files folder, thus I decided to add it but it hasn't been tested.

However, any DAW with these characteristics should work out of the box. I would
appreciate anybody confirming more DAWs or [adding new
ones](https://github.com/gacallea/freesound-credits/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=add_a_new_daw.yml&title=feat%28DAW%29%3A+add+).
When you do request or add a new DAW, please keep the [above
table](#supported-daws) and the [extra steps](#extra-daws-steps) section in
mind for any extra information.

## Extra DAWs steps

### Renoise extraction

Extract with `unzip your_project.xrns` first. Once unzipped, you will find a
`Song.xml` file and a `SamplesData` directory containing each `Instrument`.
