# Rationale

## Conventional Commits

This project adheres to
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/),
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), and
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). They can profoundly
intertwine and, when so, they must seamlessly work in concert to fully
appreciate their benefits. With Conventional Commits central to automation
arising from combining these best practices, guaranteeing that all commits
adhere to it becomes paramount. Manually enforcing best practices and
guaranteeing contracts in a code base befalls under the inadequate and
cumbersome category. Thus, this project relies on both
[local tooling](#local-tooling) together with CI pipelines, to make sure - as
best as they can - that changes pushed to this repository don't break contract.

## Semantic Versioning

As defined by [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/):

- Patch (1._.x) releases \_should solely_ contain bug fixes or documentation
  changes. Besides, these releases shouldn't change runtime behavior.

- Minor (1.x) releases may contain new functionality, minor dependency updates,
  deprecations, and larger internal implementation changes.

> [!IMPORTANT] This project automates versioning and adopts
> [fully automated releases](#fully-automated-releases) with
> [`release-plz`](https://release-plz.ieni.dev).

## Commits and Pull Requests

For all information about commits and pull requests, please refer to the
[Contributing](file:///docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests) guidelines.

## Intentional Code

Always strive to write
[intentional Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j4fhsLcT4k).
`Intentional Code` is much more than avoiding obscure and incomprehensible
variables and functions names; however, these are a good start give meaning to
code.

## Documentation

Always write
[documentation comments](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html)
and spellcheck them to avoid typos and mistakes.

## Application Security

This project strives, in
[a constantly evolving process](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2000/04/the_process_of_secur.html),
to apply [`AppSec`](https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-security)
[during the entire development life cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDvz8KivY_U),
as best as it can.

### Minimum Supported Rust Version

The project strives to stay up to date and on par with Rust releases, to avoid
legacy and stagnation, as `AppSec` best practices dictate.

## Local Tooling

Besides standardized [tooling](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools) and
[conventions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/style-guide/index.html), default
`rustfmt` and `clippy`, this project relies on [RustSec](https://rustsec.org) to
inspect supply chain, and [`kingfisher`](https://github.com/mongodb/kingfisher)
to avoid sharing secrets in the codebase. Likewise, this project relies on
[`markdownlint-cli2`](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2) and
[`pre-commit-hooks`](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks). All
conveniently enforced with [Git Hooks](https://githooks.com).

## Fully Automated Releases

Appropriately implementing Conventional Commits enables
[fully automated releases](https://blog.orhun.dev/automated-rust-releases/). For
this purpose, this project relies on
[release-plz](https://release-plz.ieni.dev). To
[automate changelog](https://release-plz.ieni.dev/docs/changelog/format). To
handle dependency updates,
[semantic version management](https://release-plz.ieni.dev/docs/semver-check),
and [crates.io](https://crates.io) releases. Upon successful pipelines,
`release-plz` invokes [cargo-dist](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist) to
create GitHub releases and packaging for various platforms, along with binary
artifacts and installers.
